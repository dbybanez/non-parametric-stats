During each day of May, guided by a calendar with specific intentions, all the Shrines around the world, united in a communion of supplication, will lift up their prayers, which, like the fragrance of incense, will rise up to heaven.   Thirty (30) Marian Shrines will take turns leading this prayer throughout the Church and offering the faithful a series of prayer moments for them to participate throughout the entire day.  This initiative is led by the Pontifical Council for the Promotion of New Evangelization.  ------ THE RECITATION OF THE HOLY ROSARY (The prayer of the Holy Rosary may begin with the lighting of a few candles from the previously lit candle before the image of Our Lady. The celebrant explains the meaning of the gesture and the day’s prayer intention in view of the pandemic and the particular needs of that geographic region.

Virgin Mary, turn your merciful eyes towards us amid this coronavirus pandemic. Comfort those who are distraught and mourn their loved ones who have died, and at times are buried in a way that grieves them deeply.  Be close to those who are concerned for their loved ones who are sick and who, in order to prevent the spread of the disease, cannot be close to them.  Fill with hope those who are troubled by the uncertainty of the future and the consequences for the economy and employment.  Mother of God and our Mother, pray for us to God, the Father of mercies, that this great suffering may end and that hope and peace may dawn anew.   Plead with your divine Son,  as you did at Cana, so that the families of the sick and the victims be comforted, and their hearts be opened to confidence and trust.  Protect those doctors, nurses, health workers and volunteers who are on the frontline of this emergency, and are risking their lives to save others.  Support their heroic effort and grant them strength, generosity, and continued health.

During each day of May, guided by a calendar with specific intentions, all the Shrines around the world, united in a communion of supplication, will lift up their prayers, which, like the fragrance of incense, will rise up to heaven.   Thirty (30) Marian Shrines will take turns leading this prayer throughout the Church and offering the faithful a series of prayer moments for them to participate throughout the entire day.  This initiative is led by the Pontifical Council for the Promotion of New Evangelization.  ------ THE RECITATION OF THE HOLY ROSARY (The prayer of the Holy Rosary may begin with the lighting of a few candles from the previously lit candle before the image of Our Lady. The celebrant explains the meaning of the gesture and the day’s prayer intention in view of the pandemic and the particular needs of that geographic region. The following text may be used, adapting it according to the needs of the place and situation.)

The recitation of the Holy Rosary according to the local tradition follows. At the end, after the singing of the Salve Regina and the recitation of the Litanies, the celebrant and the faithful present address the following prayer to Our Lady:  We fly to your protection,  O Holy Mother of God. In the present tragic situation,  when the whole world is prey to suffering and anxiety, we fly to you, Mother of God and our Mother, and seek refuge under your protection.  Virgin Mary, turn your merciful eyes towards us amid this coronavirus pandemic. Comfort those who are distraught and mourn their loved ones who have died, and at times are buried in a way that grieves them deeply.  Be close to those who are concerned for their loved ones who are sick and who, in order to prevent the spread of the disease, cannot be close to them.  Fill with hope those who are troubled by the uncertainty of the future and the consequences for the economy and employment.  Mother of God and our Mother, pray for us to God, the Father of mercies, that this great suffering may end and that hope and peace may dawn anew.   Plead with your divine Son,  as you did at Cana, so that the families of the sick and the victims be comforted, and their hearts be opened to confidence and trust.  Protect those doctors, nurses, health workers and volunteers who are on the frontline of this emergency, and are risking their lives to save others.  Support their heroic effort and grant them strength, generosity, and continued health.  Mary, Consolation of the afflicted, embrace all your children in distress and pray that God will stretch out his all-powerful hand and free us from this terrible pandemic, so that life can serenely resume its normal course.  To you, who shine on our journey as a sign of salvation and hope, do we entrust ourselves, O Clement, O Loving, O Sweet Virgin Mary. Amen.  ------ FAREWELL GREETING TO MOTHER MARY  Remember, O most gracious Virgin Mary, that never was it known that anyone who fled to thy protection, implored thy help, or sought thy intercession, was left unaided.  Inspired by this confidence I fly unto thee, O Virgin of virgins, my Mother. To thee do I come, before thee I stand, sinful and sorrowful.

Photo: Our Lady of Walsingham (England) #SugboanongSimbahan -------- Pope Francis is requesting that during this month of May the entire Church invoke the intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary for the end of the pandemic and, in a special way, he is inviting all of us to pray fervently for those most closely affected by it.   During each day of May, guided by a calendar with specific intentions, all the Shrines around the world, united in a communion of supplication, will lift up their prayers, which, like the fragrance of incense, will rise up to heaven.   Thirty (30) Marian Shrines will take turns leading this prayer throughout the Church and offering the faithful a series of prayer moments for them to participate throughout the entire day.  This initiative is led by the Pontifical Council for the Promotion of New Evangelization.  ------ THE RECITATION OF THE HOLY ROSARY (The prayer of the Holy Rosary may begin with the lighting of a few candles from the previously lit candle before the image of Our Lady. The celebrant explains the meaning of the gesture and the day’s prayer intention in view of the pandemic and the particular needs of that geographic region. The following text may be used, adapting it according to the needs of the place and situation.)  Dear Brothers and Sisters, in communion with the Holy Father following the example of the first Christian communities in this time of great trial, we lift up to the Lord through the intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary, unceasing supplications for the end of the pandemic.  Today, in particular, at this Shrine of [insert name of Shrine] we wish to pray for [insert prayer intention found in the appendix]. May these candles, lit from the candle that burns before the image of Our Lady, may illuminate and transform this moment of darkness into an aurora of new light.  We invite all those who follow us through our web channels to join spiritually in the recitation of this Holy Rosary with their families.   The recitation of the Holy Rosary according to the local tradition follows. At the end, after the singing of the Salve Regina and the recitation of the Litanies, the celebrant and the faithful present address the following prayer to Our Lady:  We fly to your protection,  O Holy Mother of God. In the present tragic situation,  when the whole world is prey to suffering and anxiety, we fly to you, Mother of God and our Mother, and seek refuge under your protection.  Virgin Mary, turn your merciful eyes towards us amid this coronavirus pandemic. Comfort those who are distraught and mourn their loved ones who have died, and at times are buried in a way that grieves them deeply.  Be close to those who are concerned for their loved ones who are sick and who, in order to prevent the spread of the disease, cannot be close to them.  Fill with hope those who are troubled by the uncertainty of the future and the consequences for the economy and employment.  Mother of God and our Mother, pray for us to God, the Father of mercies, that this great suffering may end and that hope and peace may dawn anew.   Plead with your divine Son,  as you did at Cana, so that the families of the sick and the victims be comforted, and their hearts be opened to confidence and trust.  Protect those doctors, nurses, health workers and volunteers who are on the frontline of this emergency, and are risking their lives to save others.  Support their heroic effort and grant them strength, generosity, and continued health.  Mary, Consolation of the afflicted, embrace all your children in distress and pray that God will stretch out his all-powerful hand and free us from this terrible pandemic, so that life can serenely resume its normal course.  To you, who shine on our journey as a sign of salvation and hope, do we entrust ourselves, O Clement, O Loving, O Sweet Virgin Mary. Amen.  ------ FAREWELL GREETING TO MOTHER MARY  Remember, O most gracious Virgin Mary, that never was it known that anyone who fled to thy protection, implored thy help, or sought thy intercession, was left unaided.  Inspired by this confidence I fly unto thee, O Virgin of virgins, my Mother. To thee do I come, before thee I stand, sinful and sorrowful.  O Mother of the Word Incarnate, despise not my petitions, but in thy mercy hear and answer me. Amen.",Photo,5/1/21 3:00 AM,4469,4469,229,2754

In my previous short message of 28 March 2021, Palm Sunday, I appealed for more fervent prayers. I also included the following at the end of the message: “…let us not forget those suffering most from this pandemic, especially the poor families and those who lost their daily income in order to put food on the table. Together, let us put our efforts to bring mercy and compassion to them.”  In short, I was saying that there is an urgency to pray to the Lord and also the urgency to manifest our charity to those most in need.  In the current situation of the pandemic, in many places, especially in areas comprising what we call the “NCR Plus”, the anxiety and fear and suffering of our brothers and sisters are more pronounced because of the intensity of the spread of Covid-19 infections. One consequence of this situation is the restriction on the mobility of people. Among those greatly affected are the daily-wage earners who have to go out to work to bring food to their tables every day.  I know that beginning last year, through our parishes and religious communities, we have been helping poor families without much publicity. We are all suffering, but let us again challenge ourselves to continue helping the most needy families in our midst. Let us continue bringing food packs and other form of assistance to them. We are happy to know that in recent days, in true bayanihan spirit, neighborhoods and communities have organized themselves to help needy families, especially with food and other basic necessities.  Another distressing situation is this: many areas and communities have been adversely affected by the Typhoon Bising, which has compounded the suffering of these people by adding great inconvenience and hardships to them in this time of the pandemic. Bp. Jose Colin M. Bagaforo, our Chairman of the CBCP Episcopal Commission on Social Action, Justice and Peace, has informed me that the staff of the Commission have already initiated bringing assistance to the communities in these areas.  The love of Christ compels us to act. It is difficult when all of us have to deal with our own difficulties and sufferings. But our faith in Jesus tells us to look first to those who are most in need. I would like to believe that true charity does not stop even when that charity and care come from people who themselves are in great need.  May Mary our Mother and Help of All Christians continue to accompany us. + Romulo G. Valles, D.D. Archbishop of Davao CBCP President 21 April 2021",Link,4/21/21 8:02 AM,2634,2636,83,2178

Mhar Balili, the parish priest, stressed out the challenge of the 500 YOC celebration: Gifted to Give. “We are called to share the blessings that we receive to others,” he said. “All our gifts come from God.”  Afterwards, 100 residents received the Bags of Hope and Quincentennial Crosses.  One of the major sponsors for this distribution is Mr. Eric Mendoza, the first COVID positive from Mandaue City and a COVID survivor. He shared his blessings with others in thanksgiving for the healing he received. “This [donation] is a form of thanksgiving for the gift of life that I received from God,” he said in his message for the recipients. “We cannot doubt what God has plans for us. For He has greater plans. I felt gifted to give today. I am very thankful for the opportunity to share my blessings to others.”  The distribution was conducted by volunteers blessed by Archbishop Jose Palma during the send-off Mass on the morning of the same day, for the safety of the volunteers and the success of the project.  #SugboanongSimbahan #500YoCCebu #GiftedtoGiveCebu",Photo,4/20/21 12:18 AM,8465,9873,581,5673

Brown, on the occasion of the 500th Year Anniversary of the Arrival of Christianity in the Philippines and Commemoration of the First Baptism in Cebu:  . . . . . .  ""It is indeed a great joy and an immense privilege for me as your Apostolic Nuncio to be here with all of you today in Cebu to commemorate the First Baptism and the Gifting of the image of the Santo Niño to Queen Juana, which took place 500 years ago today on April 14, 1521. I am profoundly grateful to His Excellency, the Most Reverend Archbishop José Palma, for having invited me to be the celebrant and preacher at this Mass on this historic occasion here in the Archdiocese of Cebu. I want to greet the concelebrating Bishops and priests, and in a special way His Eminence Cardinal Quevedo.  ""As we know, Ferdinand Magellan and his crew had reached the Philippines on March 16, 1521, landing on the then uninhabited island of Homonhon. There they collected food and water before moving on to Limasawa, where they arrived on Easter Sunday, March 31, 1521 and celebrated Holy Mass. From Limasawa, they came here to Cebu, arriving about a week later, and here the Cebu chieftain Rajah Humabon and his queen Hara Humamay were baptized, along with hundreds of their subjects, the chieftain and his queen becoming Carlos and Juana of Cebu. They were baptized by the chaplain of Magellan’s expedition, Father Pedro de Valderrama. And Magellan’s chronicler, the Venetian, Antonio Pigafetta, gave the statue of the Santo Niño to Queen Juana as a baptism gift.  ""Five hundred years ago today, the first baptisms in the Philippines, here in Cebu – we can point to that moment as the beginning of the evangelization of the Philippine Islands, the arrival of the light of Christ, the arrival of the Gospel of salvation in these islands.  ""As we heard in the first reading from the prophet Isaiah, “I will sprinkle clean water upon you to cleanse you from all your impurities, and from all your idols I will cleanse you. I will give you a new heart and place a new spirit within you, taking from your bodies your stony hearts and giving you natural hearts. I will put my spirit within you and make you live by my statutes, careful to observe my decrees”. This new spirit is the Holy Spirit; it is the breath of Jesus, the life of Jesus, which he breathed upon his apostles in the Gospel that we heard last Sunday on Divine Mercy Sunday.  ""And how beautiful it is that today we celebrate what happened 500 years ago by doing exactly the same thing that Father Pedro de Valderrama did. We will baptize; we will give rebirth in the Spirit to these seven children, by means of the water of Baptism; we will give them the light of Christ.  ""When we reflect on what happened here 500 years ago, we cannot fail to notice that Christianity arrived in the Philippines by means of a European expedition, motivated primarily by commercial and national interests. Spain sought a new route to the famous “Spice Islands” in the Moluccas. But we should not forget that Magellan’s crew was very international and, in fact, it was not exclusively European – even if Europeans made up its vast majority. In addition to the numerous Spaniards and Portuguese, there were men from Greece, Germany, Italy, Sicily, France, Malaysia, North Africa, Flanders, Holland and even Ireland.  ""So the arrival of Magellan’s boats certainly signifies the arrival of Europeans in the Philippine Islands for the first time. But as we reflect on the fact that it was a European expedition that brought the Catholic faith to the Philippines, we are confronted with a paradox. And the paradox is this: that Christianity is a faith that began in Asia and then spread throughout the world, into large parts of Asia, North Africa and Europe. The first nation to become Christian was in Asia: Armenia, at the beginning of the fourth century. Then in 1521, in God’s providence, it was through Europe that the Catholic Faith arrived in this part of Asia, in the islands of the Philippines. The Asian roots of Christianity were emphasized by Saint John Paul II in his Apostolic Exhortation published in 1999 Ecclesia in Asia, in which Saint John Paul wrote the following words: “The history of the Church in Asia is as old as the Church herself, for it was in Asia that Jesus breathed the Holy Spirit upon his disciples and sent them to the ends of the earth to proclaim the Good News and gather communities of believers” (par. 9). So, we have this paradox of the arrival of the Christian faith here in the Philippines: that the Faith which itself was born in Asia was then brought here first by means of European explorers, adventurers and colonizers, who were accompanied by missionaries.  ""And, as Saint John Paul II went on to say in that same document, it “was inevitable that the proclamation of the Gospel by Western missionaries would be influenced by the cultures from which they came” (par. 20). That should not surprise us. At the outset of the missionary proclamation of salvation, the outward forms of that proclamation would reflect the Catholic culture of the missionaries themselves. But what is beautiful about Philippine Catholicism and what we celebrate today is the fact that in these five centuries, the Catholic faith has entered deeply into Filipino culture and produced a distinctively Filipino expression of the unchanging and universal truth of the Catholic faith. We see the results of that process in countless elements of Filipino Catholicism; for example, in Simbang Gabi Masses. Today, in a special way, we see that process in our devotion to the Santo Niño. As Pope Francis recently commented in his video message to you for the 500th Anniversary of the first preaching of the Gospel in the Philippines: “The tender love of the Santo Niño […] is a symbol of the arrival of Christianity in your archipelago.” Yes, devotion to the Holy Child Jesus, to the Infant of Prague, began in Europe, and then came to the Philippines, where it has been transformed into a typically Filipino devotion, so beautifully evident in your annual Sinulog-Santo Niño Festival here in Cebu.  ""And today, 500 years after Queen Juana embraced the Child Jesus and was baptized and danced with beautiful joy, the same Catholic faith is being carried throughout the world by Filipino Catholics, not as colonizers, but in many cases as Overseas Filipino Workers, bringing with them their Catholic faith and their devotion to the Santo Niño to every corner of the world.  ""In 1521, the Catholic faith came to the Philippines by means of an expedition sent by Spain; in 2021, the Apostolic Nuncio sent to Spain by the Holy Father Pope Francis has come from the Philippines, Archbishop Bernardito Ausa. What a wonderful gift!  ""So, the faith that began in Asia was transported to this part of Asia by Europeans and now is being re-transported back to Europe and other places around the world by Filipinos. And what do we see in this? We see the universality of the Catholic faith. The Catholic faith cannot be identified with any single culture; it is rather the life-giving truth of God that can be embraced by any culture and, with time, will transform that culture so that – as here in the Philippines – that culture will give its own particular expression to the Catholic faith.  ""Now, of course, none of us can pretend that in 500 years of Christianity in the Philippines there haven’t been difficulties and contradictions – even attitudes and mentalities which at times did not reflect the message of Jesus. That is true of the Church as a whole, and it is true of the Church in the Philippines. There is light and darkness. But what we celebrate today is the light.  ""The beautiful light of Christ which shone in the heart of Queen Juana as she danced, the beautiful light of Christ which will soon shine in the children who will be baptized today, and which will be expressed by the lighted candle that their godparents will receive, as I say to the newly-baptized children: “You have been enlightened by Christ. Walk always as children of the light and keep the flame of faith alive in your hearts. When the Lord comes, may you go out to meet him with all the saints in the heavenly kingdom.” This is an aspiration that the Philippine nation, and all of us here today, can make our own on this historic day. Five hundred years ago today the Philippines was enlightened by Christ. Let us continue to walk always as children of the light, keeping the flame of faith alive in our hearts so that, when the Lord comes to call each of us, we may go out to meet him and enter into life with all the saints in the heavenly kingdom.  ""Let us turn to Our Lady, affectionately known here in Cebu as Inahang Maria, she who, together with Saint Joseph, whose year we are celebrating, took care of the Santo Niño in their humble home in Nazareth. As Pope Francis said in his video message to the Philippine nation, the Santo Niño reminds us “of the hidden life of the Holy Family in Nazareth. Mary and Joseph raised the Child Jesus with love. By opening the doors of your families to the Holy Child, you too will be able to transmit to your children the faith that you received from your parents. Thank you [Pope Francis said] for that deep sense of family, community and fraternity that keeps you firm in faith, joyful in hope and attentive in charity.” So, my dear brothers and sisters, let us ask the Holy Family – Jesus, Mary and Joseph – to bless, protect and inspire all Filipino families, especially in this difficult time of the covid pandemic. And let us recommit ourselves today to our own baptismal calling so that we will be witnesses to the light of Christ not only here in the Philippines, but indeed throughout the entire world.

When they landed, the ships discharged all their artillery. The party then proceeded to march following the standard of the Spanish king towards the platform that was built the day before. The captain and the king embraced one another, and the people joyously gathered near it, where the captain and the king sat on two chairs, one covered with red, the other with violet velvet, while the principal men sat on cushions and the others on mats. A large cross was set up in the square.  ""Then Magellan began to speak to the king through the interpreter, inciting him to the faith of Jesus Christ. He further exhorted that if the king would wish to be a good Christian, he must burn all the idols of his kingdom and replaced them with a cross. Everyone has to worship it daily on their knees and their hands joined to heaven. He showed him how make the sign of the cross, with the instruction to do it every day. The king and all his people answered that they would obey the captain’s commands and follow all that he told them.   “The captain led the king by the hand to the platform… in order to baptize him.” (Blair & Robertson, p. 158. cf. Skelton, p. 81; Stanley, p. 92.) He was given the name Carlos, the same name of the sovereign emperor.

For five centuries (and counting), WE ARE GIFTED TO GIVE! #SugboanongSimbahan #500YoCCebu #GiftedToGiveCebu  . . . . . THE FIRST BAPTISM IN THE PHILIPPINES  The year was 1521. In the island of Cebu, the first Baptism in the Philippines was celebrated. It was the Sunday morning of April the 14th, when Rajah Humabon, the King of Cebu, and fifty men accepted to be baptized by the chaplain of the Spanish fleet.   Earlier that week, Ferdinand Magellan, the captain-general, made clear to the natives that they do not become Christians to please the Spaniards or from fear of them, but must do it willfully and for the love of God. Humabon was given the Christian name Carlos, after that of the King of Spain. Later that day, the Queen of Cebu together with forty ladies was baptized, and she was given the Christian name Juana after the King of Spain's mother.  According to the expedition's chronicler Antonio Pigafetta, on that day alone, eight hundred men, women and children were baptized. And within the succeeding eight days, the whole of the island of Cebu and some neighboring islands received the Christian faith. A cross was planted in one of the villages.   Right before the baptism of Queen Juana, a wooden statue of Our Lady holding her child and a cross were shown to them. What attracted the Queen the most, however, was the little wooden boy. She begged for it for her to put in the place of the idols, and thereupon, the image of the Sto. Niño was given to her.   On that momentous day five centuries ago, King HUmabon, Queen Juana and hundreds of natives were given the gift of Faith. Christianity was born in the Philippines. This same faith has flourished in these islands through the centuries with the heroic labors of zealous missionaries.  Today, we Filipino faithful celebrates with joy the 500 Years of Christianity in the Philippines.  . . . . .

With the assistance of an interpreter, Magellan spoke at length on the subject of peace. Perceiving that those people were listening willingly to what was said to them, he began to induce them to become Christians. After talking about many other subjects, the captain then asked the delegation who would succeed their king after his death. The prince. The king had no sons but had several daughters; the prince had the eldest daughter as wife. The natives further revealed that when their father and mother grew old, they took no further account of them, rather their children commanded them. Hearing this, Magellan told them how God had made heaven and earth and all other things in the world, and that He had commanded everyone to render honor and obedience to his or her father and mother; whoever did otherwise was condemned to eternal fire.  Magellan pointed out to them many other things concerning the Christian faith. Having listened to him attentively, they besought the captain to leave them two men to teach them more. They even promised to receive them with great honor. The captain indicated that for the moment he could not leave them any of his people. If they wished, however, to be Christians, his priest would baptize them. He also promised that at another time, he would bring priests and preachers to teach them the faith.  Antonio Pigafetta, the voyage’s chronicler wrote, that Magellan told the natives not to become Christians from fear of the Spaniards, or to please them. If they wished to be converted, they must do it willingly, and for the love of God. Even though they should not become Christians, no displeasure would be done to them, but the converted would be more loved and better treated than others. Pigafetta observed that the representatives of the king all cried out that they did not wish to become Christians from fear, nor from complaisance, but of their free will.   #SugboanongSimabahan #500YoCCebu #GiftedToGiveCebu  Credits: FR.

So it gives more meaning to a gift - what you receive, what you have, perhaps it's talent, skill, or you have material goods. If it's given to you, you must not keep it to yourself. You have to share it,"" said the well-known performer and emcee, Mrs. Mary Rose Villacastin-Maghuyop.   Mrs. Maghuyop was one of the hosts during the livestreaming of the Formal Opening of the 500 Years of Christianity Celebrations in Cebu.   When asked about what she felt during the entire event, she said that it was one joy to another.   ""I got to imagine and remember many things about our practices as Catholics,"" said Mrs. Maghuyop.   She hopes that the Cebuanos, or Catholics in general, through these events, would understand more of our practices and participate in various ways.   ""I hope that they would be encouraged to participate in some way. Because the participation can be in many ways. It doesn't have to be physically present here. You can do works of mercy, reach out to others, or share about this celebration. I hope that they will be encouraged to share of themselves like gifts,"" said Mrs. Maghuyop.  #SugboanongSimbahan #500YoCCebu #GiftedToGiveCebu",Photo,4/6/21 2:00 AM,3795,4007,179,2005

It is the morning prayer of the church on Holy Thursday, Good Friday and Holy Saturday. It involves extinguishing candles one by one [after each psalm].   The final [lighted] candle is removed by a server or cleric, and hidden behind a curtain or the altar, signifying the burial of Our Lord in the tomb. A noise is made, symbolizing the earthquake at the Crucifixion. In some locations, the clerics and congregation knock on their pews for a time. The candle is finally extinguished, and replaced on the hearse.   While the majority of the ceremonies of the Catholic Church are joyous and celebratory, Tenebrae stands in stark contrast.
